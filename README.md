## My process

### Built with

This was a very simple challange but it gave me some clarity on how media queries function, specifically the use of min-widths and max-widths, as well as the common breakpoints used.

I was also reminded on the importance of mobile-first designing in responsive designs

### Continued development

I realised I need for practice on building responsive websites

### Useful resources
